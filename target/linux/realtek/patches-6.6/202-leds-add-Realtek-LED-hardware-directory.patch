Subject: leds: add Realtek LED hardware directory
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Realtek LED hardware peripherals share some common features. They are
typically controlled through a register field, a few bits in size. These
allow the LED to be turned off or on, or toggled at one of a number of
intervals.
